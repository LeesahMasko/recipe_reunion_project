// ideas:  One basic page that show the recipe on the right
// a place where you can see who else in your 'reunion' has snagged that recipe
// a place where you can upload a video with recipe instructions/how-to's or just talking about the food and memories associated with it
// a place where you can send a specific recipe to your friend's cookbook
// a place where you can click "working on this now" to show people that you are actively cooking or "Going to make this tonight"
// a place to show modifications you've made (versions) to recipes ("I didn't have any milk, I used half&half and it turned out awesome!")
// a place where you can see what your friends have recently started, planning to start or reccomending
// maybe tabs??

//Ingredients (parsed) should look something like this:
// "ingredientParsed": {
//    "quantity": 2.5,
//    "unit": "tablespoon",
//    "product": "parsley",
//    "preparationNotes": "finely chopped",
// }
